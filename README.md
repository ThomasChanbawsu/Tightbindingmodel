# Tightbindingmodel
personal study project in using code to create energy band diagrams by TBM

As the title suggests, this file is really just a personal study on building energy band diagrams through the mathematical method in tight binding theorem
and understanding how the material's properties can be deduced based on it. This work includes analysis on some of the basic (quote on quote easier) 
models such as 2d square lattice, graphene(hexagonal with two atom basis) and silicon. Bonus material also includes a look on Rashba hamiltonian which
implies a splitting of the energy band due to an inversion asymmetry induced by an E-field. Certain paper references were used and listed in the notebook.
If there are any things that can be improved, let me know :)
